# MMO Stuff
## LinearOptimization:
- Dichotomy minimum search
- Golden ratio minimum search
## DimensionalOptimization:
### Gradient Methods:
- Fast Descent (uses linear search from LinearOptimization inside)
- Step division (begins with predifined step size and decreases it by lamda when needed)
### Non-gradient methods:
- Coordinate descent

## Requiremnts:
- .NET Core 3.1
