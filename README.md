# MMO Stuff
## LinearOptimization:
### Unimodal optimization:
- Dichotomy minimum search
- Golden ratio minimum search
### Global optimization:
- Uniform brute force
- Sequential brute force
- Polyline method
## DimensionalOptimization:
### Gradient Methods:
- Fast Descent (uses linear search from LinearOptimization inside)
- Step division (begins with predefined step size and decreases it by lambda when needed)
### Non-gradient methods:
- Coordinate descent

## Requirements:
- .NET 6
